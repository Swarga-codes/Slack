Because of my background as a digital\/web manager I've decided to niche into content marketing writing on technical content for tools I use day-to-day such as CMS platforms, email marketing platforms, web analytics, QA software. I have years of firsthand exposure and practical expertise in using these tools from my day job. My question is -- particularly for content marketers who already work in this space -- how much expertise do I need to develop in these tools, and what type of expertise, in order to write well enough about them for clients in content marketing? For example, I have years of experience using and maintaining Wordpress websites as a web manager and I've collaborated with digital agencies to build and redesign websites using this platform. Now I'd like to write about Wordpress as a content marketing writer.  Any tips on how to find companies who hire content writers on this, what aspects of Wordpress to write about,, what types of on spec samples to create for my portfolio to attract these types of clients?  One thing: I have a technical enough background to understand how Wordpress works and manage websites and web content day-to-day using that tool. I am, however, NOT a developer or a designer. I was wondering if that is sufficient for me to be a content marketing writer focusing on Wordpress? Thanks for any advice!",

        "text": "<@U01MVN90X9U> I think you’re on a great track here! I worked as an in-house content marketer for startups for about 10 years before I transitioned to freelancing, so I always wore a lot of hats and have a pretty broad generalist background. This led me to naturally gravitate towards martech clients that want content on marketing activities written by someone with a background in marketing. I think you have plenty of expertise to specialize in areas like Wordpress or CMS’s. In my experience, it’s most important to have an in-depth understanding of the audience’s needs and concerns rather than the tech itself—which you already do, given that you WERE that audience in the past. Your clients should still provide input on research sources or internal SMEs to interview about their specific products or use cases they want you to cover.",

I worked as an in-house content marketer for startups for about 10 years before I transitioned to freelancing, so I always wore a lot of hats and have a pretty broad generalist background. This led me to naturally gravitate towards martech clients that want content on marketing activities written by someone with a background in marketing. I think you have plenty of expertise to specialize in areas like Wordpress or CMS’s. In my experience, it’s most important to have an in-depth understanding of the audience’s needs and concerns rather than the tech itself—which you already do, given that you WERE that audience in the past. Your clients should still provide input on research sources or internal SMEs to interview about their specific products or use cases they want you to cover."
